![Cryus Banner](assets/cryus-banner.png)

## Overview

Cryus is an advanced AI-driven token generation platform that enables users to create, deploy, and manage custom tokens on multiple blockchains with minimal technical knowledge. Leveraging powerful AI capabilities, Cryus simplifies the token creation process while ensuring high-quality, secure smart contracts.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Token Generation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Simply describe your token in natural language, and our AI will extract all necessary parameters
- **Intelligent Feature Recommendation**: Receive tailored suggestions based on your project requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Get instant feedback on potential vulnerabilities and security concerns
- **Automated Configuration**: Convert user conversations into technical specifications automatically

### Blockchain Support
- **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**: Fully integrated with BSC for cost-effective token deployment
- **Multiple Templates**: Various BEP-20 token templates including standard, mintable, full-featured, and advanced tax options
- **Future Expansion**: Planned support for Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and more

### Token Features
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure name, symbol, supply, decimals, and more
- **Advanced Functionality**: Support for features like minting, burning, pausing, transaction taxes, anti-bot protection, and more
- **Modular Design**: Mix and match features based on your project needs

### Security and Quality Assurance
- **Security-First Approach**: All templates follow industry best practices and security standards
- **Automated Auditing**: Basic security checks are performed on all generated tokens
- **Transparent Deployment**: Full visibility into contract code and deployment process

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Blockchain Connectivity**: Ethers.js, Web3.js
- **AI Services**: Natural language processing for token configuration extraction
- **Smart Contract Management**: Custom template system with feature-based selection
